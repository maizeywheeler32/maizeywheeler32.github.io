    <p>I found her screaming on our porch when I was 15&semi; she was starving and very sad, but I bugged my parents until they let me keep her. Now she's obsessed with me and gets mad if she has to go too long without cuddles.</p>

      <li>Meowing very loudly</li>

    </ul>

    </ul>
   
    <h2>Disikes</h2>

      <li>Men &#40;I don't know why but good for her&#41;</li>
      <li>Loud noises</li>

    <p>This is all very fun and goofy but genuinely my cat is my favorite thing in the world and I wouldn't be here without her. Siati if you see this I love you stinky.</p>
